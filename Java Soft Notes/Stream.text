Collectin  : If we want to represent a group of the objects as single entity then we should go for the collection .

Stream : if we want to process of the objects from the collection-stream or array
                                    or
        A Stream is a sequence of elements that supports various operations to process data. It's not a data structure—it doesn't store data—it just pulls data from a source (like a collection or array) and applies operations.

Key Features of Streams:

1.Doesn't modify the original collection

2.Lazy (calculates only when needed)

3.Can chain multiple operations (filter, map, sort, etc.)

4.Can be sequential or parallel

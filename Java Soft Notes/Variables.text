What is a variable?
A variable is like a container where you store a value (like a name, number, or true/false).

Types of variables used:

Type	  Variable Name	    Value	 Description
int	          age	          25  	 Whole number
String	      name	         "Aman"	  Text
float	      height	      5.9f	  Decimal number
boolean	      isStudent	      true	  True or false


📝 Variable Rules in Java

1.Must start with a letter, _, or $
2.No spaces allowed
3.Can't use Java keywords (like class, int, etc.)
4.Variable names are case-sensitive.

There are two types of the variable :
1.Based On Datatypes
2.Based On Scope and Visiblity

1.Based On Data Type : A variable which is Depent on datatypes that variable is called based on data type variable .
we have two types of the this variable
a.Primitive Variables
b.Non Primitive Variables

🔹A.Primitive Variables : A variable which is created with primitive data types is called primitive data types .
Example : int a=10 ;
int is primitive data type .

🔹B.Non Primitive Variable : A variable which is created with non primitive data tyeps is called non primitive variable .
Example : String name :"Kohli"
Here String is non primitive data types

2.Based on scope and Visiblity
There are three types:
🔹 A. Local Variable
Declared inside a method or block
Only accessible inside that method
Created when the method is called and destroyed when it ends

public class LocalExample {
    public void greet() {
        String message = "Hello, I'm a local variable!";
        System.out.println(message);
    }

    public void anotherMethod() {
        // System.out.println(message); ❌ Error: message not accessible here
    }
}
🔹B.1.Globle Non static Variable
Declared inside a class but outside any method
Belongs to the object (non-static)
Can be accessed by all non-static methods in that class

public class InstanceExample {
    int age = 25; //Globle Variable

    public void showAge() {
        System.out.println("Age: " + age); // we can access non static variable direct in non static context but in static we required object to access those variable
    }
}
🔹B.2.Globle Static Variable
Declared inside a class with the static keyword
Belongs to the class, not to objects
Shared among all instances of the class

public class StaticExample {
    static String college = "ABC University"; // static variable

    public void showCollege() {
        System.out.println("College: " + college); // accessible any where because of the static member is accessable any where in class
    }
}
